2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock instance_name/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock sysclk_p and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#1 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT CU/Sum11_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#2 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT clk_BUFG_inst_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#1 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin sampleC_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin sampleC_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin sampleC_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock instance_name/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin instance_name/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>
